# Simon: Morph Edition
### Exercise your memory muscles with this game of tones, lights, and patterns.

This app is a browser based implementation of the original Simon game. The game creates a pattern of tones and lights, and challenges the user to repeat the pattern in exact sequence. This user interface features morphing text that reminds the user whose turn it is and whether they've succeeded or failed.

User can:

* See the same series of button presses but with an additional step each time they input the pattern correctly
* Hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series plays for them and when they press a button
* Get notified when they press a wrong button and the series of starts again to remind them of the pattern so they can try again
* Win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct

Tech Highlights:

* Used **JS async functions** to control how the game responds to user interactions
* Composed the functionality of the CPU and player objects with small factory functions
